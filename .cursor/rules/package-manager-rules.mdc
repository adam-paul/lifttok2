# Package Manager Rules

<rule>
name: package_manager_standards
description: Standards for package management in the project
priority: high

guidelines: |
  1. Always use Bun as the package manager
     - NO npm
     - NO yarn
     - NO pnpm
     - ONLY bun

  2. Common commands translation:
     ```
     npm install -> bun install
     npm run -> bun run
     npm add -> bun add
     npm remove -> bun remove
     ```

  3. For clean reinstalls:
     ```
     rm -rf node_modules bun.lockb
     bun install
     ```

  4. Performance benefits:
     - Bun is significantly faster than npm/yarn
     - Better dependency resolution
     - Native support for monorepos
     - Built-in bundling and transpilation

  5. Version control:
     - Always commit bun.lockb
     - Never commit node_modules

  6. Scripts in package.json should use bun syntax:
     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "start": "bun run index.js",
         "android": "bun run react-native run-android"
       }
     }
     ```
